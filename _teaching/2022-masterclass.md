The Master Class for Computer Science students takes place every second week and is mandatory for all students who are in their second year, i.e., in their research year (Specialisation courses and the Master's Thesis Research Project). The Master Class aims at stimulating active interaction of students with their classmates, discussing open problems, issues, etc., and helping students to stay on track. Each student is asked to give a brief presentation in the Master Class about their Masterâ€™s Thesis Research Project. About the research topic and goals, the status and (expected) results. In addition, we will discuss topics such as the structure of a Master's Thesis, writing scientific publications, presenting a scientific paper, time management and other soft skills. In addition to these there are a number of guest lectures from companies, PhD students and entrepeneurs to prepare you for the job market after you graduate.

The Master Class is of course also open to LIACS staff members and thesis supervisors.
