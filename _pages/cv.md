{% include base_path %}

I received my Bachelor in Computer Science in 2011 and my Masters degree in
2013, both at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden
University. In 2012, I founded a software company, Van Stein & Groentjes VOF,
together with Tom Groentjes, which turned into a B.V. in 2014, with the hiring
of our first employee. At the same time, I continued in academia by gaining my
Ph.D. degree in 2018, doing a PostDoc in the CIMPLO project and currently I
am an assistant professor in the Natural Computing group at LIACS. My research
interests are focused on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of
optimization and time-series data with industrial applications such as predictive
maintenance and schedule optimization. Next to research, I am active at the University as manager of the Applied Data Science Lab, member of the Institute
Council, teacher of the bi-weekly Master Class and the Data Science course, su-
pervisor of 5 Ph.D. students, several Bsc and Msc students per semester and as
technical support for a number of computing clusters.
My experience from my entrepreneurial and software development activities, to-
gether with my research, collaborations, and management activities at LIACS,
define who I am as a professional.
