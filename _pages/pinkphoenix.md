Dive into the bizarre and enchanting world of the Mad Mage! This adventure and Roll20 art pack includes vibrant maps, imaginative character tokens, and modular pieces to enhance your virtual tabletop campaigns.

The Pocket Universe of the Mad Mage is a grand adventure for four to six characters between levels 5 and 10.
It can be used as a stand-alone adventure or even as a setting to play additional side quests and adventures.

The adventure consists of several storylines and NPC backgrounds to provide many opportunities for role-playing.
It is not a sequential adventure, as, the choices of the players greatly affect the direction, order, and outcome of each task.

The adventure is written for the Forgotten Realmstm  setting but can also be used with any other setting.

Find the Mad Mage and get your wish fullfilled. Adventure awaits!
