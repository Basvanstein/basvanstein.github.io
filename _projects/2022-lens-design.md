The aim of this project is to apply and develop ML and Optimization techniques to practical lens design problems in optical imaging and optical metrology. With the advent of computational imaging and computational metrology, the requirements of both the illumination and detector branches of the sensor become complete different from known designs and implementations: previous designs cannot be employed. With this work we aim to compete on international level on this topic.
