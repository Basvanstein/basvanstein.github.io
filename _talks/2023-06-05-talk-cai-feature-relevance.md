Multi-channel time-series classification is a challenging task. With sometimes thousands of sensors available for real-wolrd applications, it is a daunting and difficult task to select which channels to include and which not.

This research aims to handle the following scenario:
Given a Time Series Classification (TSC) task on time series <var>T</var> with <var>M</var> channels (sensors), find the most <var>P</var> (much smaller than <var>M</var>)
relevant channels for predicting the segment-wise labels <var>L</var>.
